To me, the thrill is in figuring out how to make things work better and faster. I'm constantly searching for new ways that will improve my skills so I can keep up with developments as they happen! I like challenging myself by taking on projects that I've never done before, and working out how to solve them.

Being able to give back to the community by sharing what I know is something that really motivates me. Also, being able to learn from others and building relationships with like-minded people is something I find really rewarding.
