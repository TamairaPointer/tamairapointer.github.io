                                                 When to use a for loop vs while loop in python?



For loops are used for sequential traversal. That is, you want to iterate through a list of items in an order, one by one. 

while loops are used for conditional traversal. That is, you want to keep iterating as long as a condition is met. 



Here is an example of a for loop: 



for item in list: 

    print(item)


This will print each item in the list, one by one. 



Here is an example of a while loop: 



while condition: 

    do something





This will keep doing something as long as the condition is met. 



So, when should you use a for loop, and when should you use a while loop? If you know the exact number of times you want to iterate through a list, or if you need to iterate through a list in order, then a for loop is probably what you want. If you need to iterate through a list until a condition is met, then a while loop is probably what you want. 



Of course, there are always exceptions to these rules. But in general, this is a good guideline to follow.
